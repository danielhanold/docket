#   - the convention carries a capability-resolution rule: resolve (incl. deferred tool surfaces),
#     then attempt one trivial dispatch; only a failed attempt or a policy denial proves absence
#   - the rule is stated by CAPABILITY: an absent tool NAME is explicitly not sufficient evidence
#   - the tiered unavailability posture (A deterministic / B adversarial / C discipline) is present
#   - Tier C is drawn AGAINST the Skill layer's missing-skill rule, not layered on top of it
#   - every CONSUMING dispatch site names its tier (producer coverage, not definition-only)
#   - no live docket prose gates a decision on a literal tool name (shape-scoped, no allowlist)
# Sentinels are sampling, not parsing (learnings: foundational-test-discipline) — pair with the
# whole-branch review.
