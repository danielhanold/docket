# BUDGETS comment for how a later raise is set). A future change that
# bloats a skill must slim elsewhere or consciously RAISE the budget in this table (an in-diff edit).

# BUDGETS: one row per tracked file — "<relpath> <maxLines> <maxWords>". The ORIGINAL basis of these
# rows is the 0085 post-slim actuals + ~10% (ceil). A LATER RAISE (0102, 0127, 0137) does not re-apply
# that +10% to a grown file — it sets the row to the file's re-measured actual plus a small WORKING
# MARGIN, so a subsequent one-line edit does not redden CI on arrival. Change 0137's rule for the
# rows it raises: lines rounded up to the next multiple of 5, words to the next multiple of 50 —
# and if that lands within 25 words of the actual, the multiple AFTER it, because a rule that can
# leave a 4-word margin reproduces the failure mode this paragraph exists to forbid.
# Near-zero headroom is not the intent — it is the failure mode 0102 recorded below (1 word left),
# and 0137's first attempt repeated it (rounding words to the next multiple of 10 left +1 and +9).
# To raise a budget, edit the number here in the same diff that grows the file.
# docket-convention/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 5689 -> 5850 by change 0127, which added a
# whole policy dimension to the Auto-capture shared definition (classify -> admit -> suppress, and
# the filtering-precedes-the-cap rule) plus the change_types / nested auto_capture config block and
# the manifest's type: field. The section was compressed by ~150 words first (the mint-sites,
# materiality, and deterministic-mint paragraphs); the residual is normative text with no other
# home. The line budget was NOT raised.
# docket-finalize-change/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 4060 -> 4200 by change 0102, which grew
# the file to 4059/4060 words (1 word of headroom) while wiring finalize.require_pr_approval
# through the resolver — the next edit to that file would have reddened CI on arrival.
# docket-convention/SKILL.md's budget was raised 354/5850 -> 365/6250 by change 0137, which added
# the dispatch-capability resolution rule + its A/B/C tier table. The rule must live in SKILL.md
# itself rather than a reference: it fires at the exact moment an agent is about to wrongly
# conclude dispatch is absent, and a rule sitting in an unread reference file cannot intervene at
# that moment. Set per the rule above from the measured actual: 361 lines -> 365, 6209 words -> 6250.
# docket-implement-next/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 3315 -> 3500 by change 0137, which names
# the Tier A/C posture at its four consuming dispatch sites (Step 0's docket-status sweep and Step
# 6's docket-adr dispatch are Tier A; Step 5's build invocation and Step 6's review invocation are
# Tier C) so the convention's dispatch-capability rule has a producer at every site that actually
# dispatches, not only a definition. Two later fix rounds grew it further: pairing each site's own
# noun with its tier in the same clause (so a proximity-scoped guard can distinguish sites sharing
# one paragraph, instead of a bare tier-literal presence check that a swapped-tier mutation could
# pass), and giving Step 6's two clauses the same *Dispatch-capability resolution* back-pointer the
# other sites carry — the citation, not the tier label, is what stops an agent concluding "no
# dispatch tool". Set from the measured actual: 3445 words -> 3500 (the next multiple of 50 is 3450,
# which would leave a 5-word margin — the within-25 clause above pushes it to 3500). The LINE budget was not raised
# by this change at all — the measured actual (135 lines) still fits the pre-existing 147.
# skills/docket-build-task/SKILL.md is a NEW row added by change 0167, which introduced the
# docket-build-task worker contract. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actual:
# 99 lines -> 100, 805 words -> 850 (45 words of margin, above the within-25 threshold). The LINE
# budget was then raised 100 -> 105 in a fix round: 1 line of headroom is the exact near-zero
# failure mode this comment block warns against (see the 0102/0137 entries above), so one added
# line to SKILL.md would redden CI on arrival.
# skills/docket-build/SKILL.md is a NEW row added by change 0167, which introduced the docket-build
# controller skill. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actual: 153 lines -> 155 (2
# lines of margin), 1177 words -> 1200 would leave only 23 words of margin (within the 25-word
# threshold), so the next multiple was taken instead: 1250 (73 words of margin). The LINE budget
# was then raised 155 -> 160 in a fix round, matching the docket-build-task precedent above: 2
# lines of headroom is still near-zero relative to a routine edit, so the next multiple of 5 was
# taken instead (7 lines of margin). Change 0167's final fix wave raised it again, 160/1250 ->
# 165/1300: the whole-branch review found the controller silent on the change's most likely
# first-run failure (a profile agent not yet registered, because install.sh has not re-run since
# the opt-in went live), and that rule has to live where the dispatch happens. Measured actual
# 160 lines -> the next multiple of 5 IS 160, i.e. zero margin, so 165; 1261 words -> 1300.
# skills/docket-convention/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 6250 -> 6300 by change 0167's final
# fix wave: the *Agent layer*'s "injected into every wrapper" clause became false when the three
# docket-build profile workers shipped without docket-convention, so the clause now names both
# no-convention exceptions and why. Measured actual 6248 words fits 6250 with 2 words of margin —
# the exact near-zero failure mode this block warns about — so the rule's next multiple was taken:
# 6300. The LINE budget was not raised (361 actual, 365 budget).
# Change 0167's INDEPENDENT WHOLE-BRANCH review raised both docket-build rows again:
# docket-build/SKILL.md 165/1300 -> 225/2050 and docket-build-task/SKILL.md 105/850 -> 115/1000.
# The review's framing was that the contracts state a PREDICATE where they owe a DISPOSITION, and
# its remedy is structural rather than a phrase edit: one `## Halting conditions` section in the
# controller enumerating all nine halts and owning the shared disposition, plus an `## Inputs`
# section, the COMPLETE-commit ancestry verification, the undetectable-suite configuration-gap
# branch, the stray-commit rule, and the plan-checkbox rule; and in the worker, the metadata
# boundary its wrappers cannot get from docket-convention (they do not load it) plus the same
# checkbox rule. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actuals: controller 221 lines ->
# 225, 1989 words -> 2000 would leave 11 words (within the 25-word threshold) so the next multiple,
# 2050; worker 111 lines -> 115, 962 words -> 1000 (38 words of margin). For LINES this change read
# the same "within-25-of-a-50-step" proportion as a half-step of the 5-line step — 4 and 4 lines of
# margin both clear it, where the earlier 0/2-line margins did not.
# skills/docket-convention/SKILL.md was NOT raised by that review wave: its cardinal fix
# ("except two" -> "except four", plus the pointer at docket-build-task's own Scope) measured
# 361/6267, inside the existing 365/6300.
# references/agent-layer.md's budget was raised 168/1839 -> 175/2000 by change 0168, which moved the
# built-in layer from the twelve wrapper sources to the shipped, harness-indexed
# agents/harness-defaults.yml. The file gains the sidecar's own invariants (concrete harnesses only,
# both fields per entry, no runner:) and the unmapped-pair-ships-unpinned rule — normative text with
# no other home, since this reference IS the configuration mechanics. Set per the rule above from
# the measured actual: 172 lines -> 175, 1948 words -> 1950 is within 25, so the multiple after: 2000.
