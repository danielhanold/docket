# BUDGETS comment for how a later raise is set). A future change that
# bloats a skill must slim elsewhere or consciously RAISE the budget in this table (an in-diff edit).
# Budgets are a DIRECTION made durable, not the slim's goal (learnings: size-target-is-direction).

# BUDGETS: one row per tracked file — "<relpath> <maxLines> <maxWords>". The ORIGINAL basis of these
# rows is the 0085 post-slim actuals + ~10% (ceil). A LATER RAISE (0102, 0127, 0137) does not re-apply
# that +10% to a grown file — it sets the row to the file's re-measured actual plus a small WORKING
# MARGIN, so a subsequent one-line edit does not redden CI on arrival. Change 0137's rule for the
# rows it raises: lines rounded up to the next multiple of 5, words to the next multiple of 50 —
# and if that lands within 25 words of the actual, the multiple AFTER it, because a rule that can
# leave a 4-word margin reproduces the failure mode this paragraph exists to forbid.
# Near-zero headroom is not the intent — it is the failure mode 0102 recorded below (1 word left),
# and 0137's first attempt repeated it (rounding words to the next multiple of 10 left +1 and +9).
# To raise a budget, edit the number here in the same diff that grows the file.
# docket-convention/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 5689 -> 5850 by change 0127, which added a
# whole policy dimension to the Auto-capture shared definition (classify -> admit -> suppress, and
# the filtering-precedes-the-cap rule) plus the change_types / nested auto_capture config block and
# the manifest's type: field. The section was compressed by ~150 words first (the mint-sites,
# materiality, and deterministic-mint paragraphs); the residual is normative text with no other
# home. The line budget was NOT raised.
# docket-finalize-change/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 4060 -> 4200 by change 0102, which grew
# the file to 4059/4060 words (1 word of headroom) while wiring finalize.require_pr_approval
# through the resolver — the next edit to that file would have reddened CI on arrival.
# docket-convention/SKILL.md's budget was raised 354/5850 -> 365/6250 by change 0137, which added
# the dispatch-capability resolution rule + its A/B/C tier table. The rule must live in SKILL.md
# itself rather than a reference: it fires at the exact moment an agent is about to wrongly
# conclude dispatch is absent, and a rule sitting in an unread reference file cannot intervene at
# that moment. Set per the rule above from the measured actual: 361 lines -> 365, 6209 words -> 6250.
# docket-implement-next/SKILL.md's word budget was raised 3315 -> 3500 by change 0137, which names
# the Tier A/C posture at its four consuming dispatch sites (Step 0's docket-status sweep and Step
# 6's docket-adr dispatch are Tier A; Step 5's build invocation and Step 6's review invocation are
# Tier C) so the convention's dispatch-capability rule has a producer at every site that actually
# dispatches, not only a definition. Two later fix rounds grew it further: pairing each site's own
# noun with its tier in the same clause (so a proximity-scoped guard can distinguish sites sharing
# one paragraph, instead of a bare tier-literal presence check that a swapped-tier mutation could
# pass), and giving Step 6's two clauses the same *Dispatch-capability resolution* back-pointer the
# other sites carry — the citation, not the tier label, is what stops an agent concluding "no
# dispatch tool". Set from the measured actual: 3445 words -> 3500 (the next multiple of 50 is 3450,
# which would leave a 5-word margin — the within-25 clause above pushes it to 3500). The LINE budget was not raised
# by this change at all — the measured actual (135 lines) still fits the pre-existing 147.
# skills/docket-build-task/SKILL.md is a NEW row added by change 0167, which introduced the
# docket-build-task worker contract. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actual:
# 99 lines -> 100, 805 words -> 850 (45 words of margin, above the within-25 threshold). The LINE
# budget was then raised 100 -> 105 in a fix round: 1 line of headroom is the exact near-zero
# failure mode this comment block warns against (see the 0102/0137 entries above), so one added
# line to SKILL.md would redden CI on arrival.
# skills/docket-build/SKILL.md is a NEW row added by change 0167, which introduced the docket-build
# controller skill. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actual: 153 lines -> 155 (2
# lines of margin), 1177 words -> 1200 would leave only 23 words of margin (within the 25-word
# threshold), so the next multiple was taken instead: 1250 (73 words of margin). The LINE budget
# was then raised 155 -> 160 in a fix round, matching the docket-build-task precedent above: 2
# lines of headroom is still near-zero relative to a routine edit, so the next multiple of 5 was
# taken instead (7 lines of margin). Change 0167's final fix wave raised it again, 160/1250 ->
# 165/1300: the whole-branch review found the controller silent on the change's most likely
# first-run failure (a profile agent not yet registered, because install.sh has not re-run since
# the opt-in went live), and that rule has to live where the dispatch happens. Measured actual
# 160 lines -> the next multiple of 5 IS 160, i.e. zero margin, so 165; 1261 words -> 1300.
# skills/docket-convention/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 6250 -> 6300 by change 0167's final
# fix wave: the *Agent layer*'s "injected into every wrapper" clause became false when the three
# docket-build profile workers shipped without docket-convention, so the clause now names both
# no-convention exceptions and why. Measured actual 6248 words fits 6250 with 2 words of margin —
# the exact near-zero failure mode this block warns about — so the rule's next multiple was taken:
# 6300. The LINE budget was not raised (361 actual, 365 budget).
# Change 0167's INDEPENDENT WHOLE-BRANCH review raised both docket-build rows again:
# docket-build/SKILL.md 165/1300 -> 225/2050 and docket-build-task/SKILL.md 105/850 -> 115/1000.
# The review's framing was that the contracts state a PREDICATE where they owe a DISPOSITION, and
# its remedy is structural rather than a phrase edit: one `## Halting conditions` section in the
# controller enumerating all nine halts and owning the shared disposition, plus an `## Inputs`
# section, the COMPLETE-commit ancestry verification, the undetectable-suite configuration-gap
# branch, the stray-commit rule, and the plan-checkbox rule; and in the worker, the metadata
# boundary its wrappers cannot get from docket-convention (they do not load it) plus the same
# checkbox rule. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actuals: controller 221 lines ->
# 225, 1989 words -> 2000 would leave 11 words (within the 25-word threshold) so the next multiple,
# 2050; worker 111 lines -> 115, 962 words -> 1000 (38 words of margin). For LINES this change read
# the same "within-25-of-a-50-step" proportion as a half-step of the 5-line step — 4 and 4 lines of
# margin both clear it, where the earlier 0/2-line margins did not.
# skills/docket-convention/SKILL.md was NOT raised by that review wave: its cardinal fix
# ("except two" -> "except four", plus the pointer at docket-build-task's own Scope) measured
# 361/6267, inside the existing 365/6300.
# references/agent-layer.md's budget was raised 168/1839 -> 175/2000 by change 0168, which moved the
# built-in layer from the twelve wrapper sources to the shipped, harness-indexed
# agents/harness-defaults.yml. The file gains the sidecar's own invariants (concrete harnesses only,
# both fields per entry, no runner:) and the unmapped-pair-ships-unpinned rule — normative text with
# no other home, since this reference IS the configuration mechanics. Set per the rule above from
# the measured actual: 172 lines -> 175, 1948 words -> 1950 is within 25, so the multiple after: 2000.
# skills/docket-build/SKILL.md's budget was raised 225/2050 -> 250/2350 by change 0184, which
# retiered the three build profiles to four. The growth is almost entirely the `## Routing` rubric:
# a fourth tier adds a bullet, and the `max`/`high` boundary needed an ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE stated
# ("`max` is for mistakes this build's own correction machinery cannot walk back") rather than a
# longer trigger list, because a list is what the router over-applies. That principle plus the
# `low` tier's cross-file-reasoning condition are normative routing text with no other home — a
# reference file cannot intervene at the moment the router is choosing. Set per the rounding rule
# above from the measured actual: 247 lines -> 250, 2313 words -> 2350 (37 words of margin).
# skills/docket-review/SKILL.md is a NEW row added by change 0170, which introduced docket's own
# bounded read-only whole-branch review role. The file is a compact worker contract in the
# docket-build-task register: scope and metadata boundary, dispatch inputs, the read-only conduct
# rules, the build-evidence verification (present / result: green / head_sha equals branch HEAD,
# with the `unverified-build-state` blocker as the ONLY remedy available to a reviewer), what is in
# and out of review scope, the finding schema plus verdict line, and the abort-and-report halting
# posture. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actuals: 96 lines -> the next multiple
# of 5 is 100, but 4 lines of margin is the near-zero mode this block warns about at a file this
# short, so the multiple after was taken (105), matching the docket-build-task precedent; 746 words
# -> 750 is within the 25-word threshold, so the multiple after: 800 (54 words of margin).
# skills/docket-convention/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 6300 -> 6350 by change 0170's rung
# wrappers. The roster grew thirteen -> sixteen, so the *Agent layer* opening now enumerates a
# seventh wrapped skill (`docket-review`, shared by its three rung wrappers), the convention-
# injection clause names an exception set of eight rather than the four it claimed while listing
# five, and the *Composition* tally gains the review rungs as their own class. All three are count
# prose the suite asserts on, so they have no other home. Set per the rounding rule above from the
# measured actual: 6301 words -> the next multiple of 50 is 6350 (49 words of margin). The LINE
# budget was not raised (361 actual, 365 budget) — every edit reflowed inside an existing line.
# skills/docket-build/SKILL.md's budget was raised 250/2350 -> 265/2450 by change 0170, which made
# the gate's GREEN path mint the build-evidence record and added it to the `## Output` list of
# stable emitted lines. The growth is the record's literal shape: a marker-bounded fenced block
# naming `command` / `result` / `head_sha` / `ran_at`. That shape is a cross-skill contract two
# consumers grep verbatim (`docket-implement-next` Step 6 validates it, `docket-finalize-change`
# reads it out of the PR body), so it has to be quoted where the producer writes it — a prose
# summary or a pointer to a reference file would leave the producer free to drift from the readers.
# Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actuals: 263 lines and 2417 words. 263 -> the
# next multiple of 5 is 265, which leaves 2 lines of margin — the near-zero mode this block warns
# about twice above (docket-build-task 100 -> 105, docket-build 155 -> 160) — so the multiple after
# was taken: 270 (7 lines of margin). 2417 words -> 2450 (33 words of margin, above the 25-word
# threshold). An earlier revision of this paragraph recorded the actuals as 262/2414 and set the
# line budget to 265; both numbers were wrong and the 2-line margin was the failure mode itself.
# skills/docket-implement-next/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 3500 -> 3900 by change 0170, which
# gave Step 6 the three things the review role cannot infer: the build-evidence validation (present,
# green, `head_sha` at HEAD, else re-run the suite once), the deterministic rung selection (the
# build's highest routed-or-escalated profile, one step up past 1500 changed lines, capped at deep),
# and the severity triage (blockers through the `docket-build-task` ladder plus one suite re-run,
# important/minor to the PR body, no re-review round). Step 7 gained the marker-bounded evidence
# block that `docket-finalize-change` reads. Every one of those is a rule another agent executes
# verbatim, so none of it compresses into a pointer. Set per the rounding rule above from the
# measured actual: 3839 words -> the next multiple of 50 is 3850, within the 25-word threshold, so
# the multiple after: 3900 (61 words of margin). The LINE budget was not raised (143 actual, 147
# budget) — the new prose is four paragraphs inside the existing 147-line ceiling.
# docket-finalize-change/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 4200 -> 4350 by change 0170, which gave
# the rebase-retest gate a conditional skip of its post-rebase LOCAL suite run. The growth is one
# numbered flow item, and it is all predicate: the skip is admissible only on the conjunction of a
# no-op rebase, a parseable `docket:build-evidence` block with `result: green`, and a `head_sha`
# equal to the branch HEAD being merged — plus the fail-toward-running posture, the audit line, and
# the scoping that leaves `ci`, `both`'s CI leg, and `off` alone. A shortened version would be a
# predicate an agent has to guess at, and guessing wrong here merges an untested branch onto the
# integration branch. Set per the rounding rule above from the measured actual: 4285 words -> the
# next multiple of 50 is 4300, within the 25-word threshold, so the multiple after: 4350 (60 words
# of margin). The LINE budget was not raised (191 actual, 193 budget) — the new item is two lines.
# docket-implement-next/SKILL.md's WORD budget was raised 3900 -> 3950 by change 0170's whole-branch
# review fixes, which closed two gaps in Step 6/7 prose that another agent executes verbatim: rung
# selection had no defined input when `skills.build` is not `docket-build` (the SHIPPED default
# emits no build record at all), so it now names `docket-review-standard` as the no-record rung; and
# Step 7's evidence block now says that a step-6.5 results commit — like any post-gate commit —
# moves HEAD past the minted `head_sha`, so staleness there is expected and finalize simply runs the
# suite. Both are rules, not commentary: an unstated default is a rule with no input, and an
# unexplained staleness reads as a defect to whoever meets it next. Set per the rounding rule above
# from the measured actual: 3923 words -> 3950 (27 words of margin, just above the 25-word
# threshold). The LINE budget was not raised (143 actual, 147 budget) — every edit reflowed inside
# an existing line.
