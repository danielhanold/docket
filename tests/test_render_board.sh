# --- Guard 1: the repo-wide render-board.sh WRITE sentinel (change 0070) ----------------------
# THE INVARIANT, stated once: render-board.sh's stdout reaches a file through board-refresh.sh
# and NOTHING else.
#
# Every guard that came before encoded a PROXY for that sentence — "a --format digest flag is
# present" (tests/test_docket_status.sh), "a ` > ` appears near the string BOARD.md" (REDIRECT_RE,
# below) — and every known evasion is an exploit of the gap between the proxy and the invariant.
# This guard prohibits the WRITE instead of recognizing the write TARGET, so it never matches a
# filename and cannot be evaded by renaming one:
#     >"$d/BOARD.md"   (no space — the IDIOMATIC shell form, which REDIRECT_RE cannot see)
#     >> / >|          (append and clobber-force)
#     > "$mw/$rel"     (VARIABLE target — the literal string "BOARD.md" appears nowhere near the
#                       redirect, so NO regex keyed on /BOARD\.md can reach it AT ANY WIDTH; this
#                       is what forecloses "just widen REDIRECT_RE" as a complete answer)
#     &> / &>> / >&f   (the merged-output forms — see stage 3; each one really does write the file)
# all die identically. It never asks WHERE you are writing.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUALLY CHECKS, stated without overclaim: for each render-board.sh invocation TOKEN, is
# there a surviving `>` after fd dups are erased. That is a SOURCE-SYNTAX property of the token,
# not a filesystem fact — so it catches every redirect written ON the invocation, and it cannot
# see a write reached INDIRECTLY (through a pipe, or through an fd opened elsewhere). Those are
# named in KNOWN, ACCEPTED GAPS below rather than papered over.
#
# The call-site list is DERIVED FROM A find(1) SWEEP, never hand-maintained (ledger #64: never
# hand-list the call sites of an operation you are gating). The sweep covers scripts/lib/*.sh,
# which a flat scripts/*.sh glob would silently miss. board-refresh.sh — the one gated writer
# (change 0059: render to temp -> chmod -> rename) — is the ONLY allowlisted script.
#
# PIPELINE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING:
#   1. STRIP COMMENTS FIRST — drop whole-line ones, THEN strip trailing ones. Prose that merely
#      NAMES the script is not an invocation. render-adr-index.sh, render-change-links.sh, and
#      render-board.sh itself mention it in comments ONLY, so this step is what keeps them out of
#      the scan, not a nicety. The trailing strip (a `#` preceded by whitespace, to end of line) is
#      equally load-bearing: whole-line stripping alone leaves
#      `render-board.sh ... 2>&2  # digest -> stdout only` with a bare `>` from the comment's
#      ARROW, turning the guard RED on a legitimate call — and this codebase's comment style is
#      full of `->` arrows, so that is a live trap, not a hypothetical.
#      TRADE-OFF, DISCLOSED NOT HIDDEN: a `#` inside a QUOTED ARGUMENT on a render-board.sh
#      invocation line would truncate that line early and could hide a redirect placed after it.
#      No such invocation exists (render-board.sh's only arguments are --changes-dir, --repo, and
#      --format, none of which take a `#`), and the strip fixes a false positive that is real
#      today against a false negative that requires a flag this renderer does not have.
#   2. ONLY THEN JOIN backslash-continuations into logical lines. The tokenizer is line-oriented,
#      so a redirect parked on a continuation line hands it a first-line token with no `>` — a
#      clean pass. (REDIRECT_RE survived that shape only because it flattens the file with `tr`
#      first; that flattening was never incidental. Guard 1 subsumes the scan it replaces ONLY
#      because it joins.)
#      WHY COMMENTS MUST BE STRIPPED BEFORE THE JOIN, NOT AFTER — this ordering is a FIX, and the
#      obvious order (join, then strip) is EXPLOITABLE. Bash comments are PHYSICAL-LINE scoped: a
#      trailing backslash does NOT continue a comment onto the next line. So in
#          # regenerate the board \
#          "$SCRIPTS_DIR"/render-board.sh --changes-dir "$d" > "$out"
#      the second line REALLY EXECUTES and REALLY WRITES THE FILE (proven against a stub renderer).
#      Join-first folds it INTO the comment, and the comment drop then deletes BOTH lines — the
#      write is laundered and the guard passes clean. Stripping first deletes only the comment,
#      leaving the live invocation (and its `>`) standing alone. The continuation rows below still
#      go RED under this order because NEITHER of their lines is a comment: the join still happens,
#      it just no longer runs on text that a comment can swallow.
#   3. NORMALIZE `&>`/`&>>` TO `>`, THEN ERASE ONLY TRUE fd DUPS, both BEFORE tokenizing. Subtle
#      and mandatory, in this order:
#        - `&>file` and `&>>file` are WRITES (stdout+stderr merged into the file). The tokenizer
#          splits on `; & |`, so the `&` of `&>` would END the token BEFORE its `>` — the write
#          would vanish. Rewriting `&>`/`&>>` to a bare `>` first makes them ordinary writes.
#        - the fd-dup erasure must key on the TARGET BEING A WHOLE, REAL fd — not on the operator,
#          and not merely on the target's PREFIX. `>&2`, `2>&1`, `>&-` dup/close a descriptor
#          (harmless), but `>&"$out"` and `>& file` are WRITES that share the same `>&` spelling.
#          So the erasure requires a digit run or `-` after the `&` AND A RIGHT BOUNDARY after
#          that: `[0-9]*>&([0-9]+|-)($|[[:space:];&|)}"])`. Both halves are bugs already paid for:
#            * without the digit/`-` requirement (`[0-9-]*`), the class matches ZERO characters and
#              erases `>&"$out"` outright, laundering a file write into nothing.
#            * without the RIGHT BOUNDARY, the erasure is a PREFIX match: bash reads `>&word` with
#              a word that is not a valid fd as a merged WRITE, so `>&2board.md` really creates the
#              file `2board.md` — yet an unanchored `>&([0-9]+|-)` eats the `>&2` and leaves a bare
#              `board.md` with no `>` left to find (proven against a stub renderer). The boundary
#              makes the erasure fire only when the descriptor ENDS there.
#        Erasing the true dups first also keeps the `&` of `2>&2` from CUTTING the token
#        mid-redirect and leaving a dangling `>` that fires on the codebase's CORRECT invocation.
#   4. TOKENIZE PER INVOCATION, not per line: a logical line carrying a clean call beside a rogue
#      one must not be whitewashed by the clean one (ledger #64). The invocation is recognized at a
#      WORD BOUNDARY — `(^|[^-[:alnum:]])render-board\.sh` — not at a leading `/`: a PATH-resolved
#      `render-board.sh ... > "$out"` (no directory part) writes the file just as surely as
#      `"$SCRIPTS_DIR"/render-board.sh` does, and keying on the slash would miss it. The boundary
#      still excludes a merely SIMILAR name (`my-render-board.sh` is not this script).
#   5. ANY surviving `>` in a token is a file-directed redirect => violation. This rejects even a
#      stderr-to-file form (2>/dev/null) — deliberately conservative: the correct way to route
#      this renderer's stderr is the fd dup already in use (2>&2), and a guard that permits SOME
#      writes is a guard whose next author must relitigate which.
#
# KNOWN, ACCEPTED GAPS — both are INDIRECT writes, invisible to any source scan of the invocation
# line, and both have the SAME answer (see below). They are disclosed, not fixed:
#   a. PIPE INTO A WRITER: `render-board.sh ... | tee f`. The tokenizer ends the invocation at the
#      `|`, so the writer on the far side is never examined.
#   b. fd INDIRECTION — a redirect OPENED ON A PRIOR LINE, in either of two shapes:
#        - `exec 3>"$out"`, then `render-board.sh ... >&3`. The file IS written, and the guard
#          stays green because `>&3` is — syntactically, locally, and correctly — an fd dup.
#        - `exec > "$out"`, then a BARE `render-board.sh ...` with NO redirect on it at all. Here
#          the invocation token carries no `>` whatsoever, so there is nothing for ANY tightening
#          of stages 3-5 to catch: the write lives entirely on the earlier `exec` line.
#      A scan of the invocation cannot know what an fd was opened to, or that stdout was rebound
#      out from under it; it would have to follow descriptors across statements, which is
#      interpretation, not grep.
# The answer to BOTH is the filesystem-effect test the design DEFERRED (run the orchestrator
# against a fixture, assert BOARD.md's bytes): it is syntax-independent but path-dependent, and it
# earns its cost when a write path exists that a source scan cannot reach. Today none does.
#
# The battery below is the substance of this guard (ledger #64: a guard is code — mutation-test it
# before trusting it, or it is decoration). Every evasion above is injected into a fixture and MUST
# turn the guard RED; the fd-dup control — the codebase's real invocation — MUST keep it GREEN.

# Folds backslash-continuations into logical lines. awk, not sed: BSD sed does not portably treat
# `\n` in an s/// LHS as a newline, so the classic `:a; /\\$/N; s/\\\n//; ta` is a GNU-ism here.
# TWIN: an identical function lives in tests/test_docket_status.sh (Guard 3 tokenizes the same
# unit and inherits the same fix) — keep the two in step.

# 0 = clean; 1 = at least one render-board.sh invocation carries a file-directed redirect.
# Stage order per the block above: comments OUT first (a comment cannot continue across a trailing

# `&>`, THEN erase whole-and-only-whole fd dups, THEN tokenize per invocation at a word boundary.

# (7)-(10) THE MERGED-OUTPUT FORMS. Every one of these REALLY WRITES THE FILE — verified by
#     running each against a stub renderer and stat'ing the target — and every one of them slipped
#     past the guard's first cut, for two independent reasons worth naming separately:
#       - `&>` / `&>>`: the tokenizer's `[^;&|]*` treats the `&` as a command separator, so the
#         token ENDED before the `>` and the write disappeared. Fixed by normalizing to a bare `>`
#         ahead of tokenizing (pipeline stage 3).
#       - `>& file`: the fd-dup erasure keyed on the OPERATOR `>&` rather than on whether the
#         target is a real descriptor, and its `[0-9-]*` happily matched ZERO characters — so
#         `>&"$out"`, a file write, was erased outright. Fixed by REQUIRING a digit run or `-`.
#     These four rows are the reason the erasure regex may never be loosened back to `[0-9-]*`.

#   render-board\.sh.{0,200}[[:space:]]>[[:space:]].{0,200}/BOARD\.md
# Design (each element defends a specific real shape in this codebase's prose):
#   - `.{0,200}` bounded any-char gaps (NOT `[^>]*`): the historical redirect's destination is
#     a bracket placeholder `<metadata working tree>/<changes_dir>/BOARD.md` whose `>` characters
#     and internal spaces a `[^>]*` class could never cross — so `[^>]*` was BLIND to the exact
#     reintroduction shape this sentinel exists to catch. `.` crosses placeholder `>`s freely.
#   - `[[:space:]]>[[:space:]]` a whitespace-bounded redirect operator: a real ` > ` redirect has
#     a space on both sides, whereas a placeholder's closing bracket is `tree>` / `dir>/` (letter
#     before `>`, or no space after) — so the porcelain guard line and every `<...>` placeholder
#     are structurally excluded.
#   - `/BOARD\.md` (slash required, not bare `BOARD.md`): a real redirect target is a PATH ending
#     in `/BOARD.md`; this rejects a flattened markdown blockquote (`\n> ` -> ` > `) that lands a
#     bare "BOARD.md" prose word within the window — blockquotes genuinely appear in
#     docket-status and docket-implement-next, so this is a live false-positive class, not
#     hypothetical.
# All five requirements + the blockquote case are verified empirically below and by the
# positive-control assertion. THE SAME REGEX is used for both the positive control and the
# across-skills scan, so weakening it (e.g. back to `[^>]*`) trips the positive control loudly.
